    - No line breaks inside steps.
    - Do not add any extra content like "AI-Powered Roadmap", headers, or links.
    - No bullet points, no bold text.
    - No summary or intro.
    
    Example:
    1. Learn Basics: Study fundamental programming concepts using Python or JavaScript.
    2. Build Projects: Create small real-world projects to solidify your understanding.

Rules:
- Include AT LEAST 5 steps.
- Do NOT repeat step titles.
- Follow the exact format below for EACH step.
- Add meaningful dependencies.
